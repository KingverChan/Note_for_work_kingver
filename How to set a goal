I always set a very high goal before I start to work.
At the begingning, my pasion is too much to overflow.
However, my pasion retreat day by day and finally I think the goal is too high to attatch and the time is not enough.

I read some book about how to clutivate a habit.
Here is what i get to share with youï¼š
1: a low goal is not a shame.
  It's not a shame to set a small goal. And It's not an honer to set a high goal.
  Only the goal which can fullfill is the good goal.

2: set different level for a goal.
  For example, if you want to set a goal about to remember 300 english words.
  You can dispart the goal in 3 levels>
  level one: 100 words
  level two: 200 words
  level three: 300 words
  And no matter which level you get, you are the hero of yourself.
  Oh~ I am too busy today, but it dosen't matter, i can just remeber 100 words today so that I can still get my goal.
  The magic of this way to set the goal, is you can matain your pasion as long as posible.
  If you tell yourself you must remember 300 word everyday once you find that the time is not enough
  that day, and you will pass this goal. And you get the first time, the second time, the third time is on the way.
  
  If you have a long time goal, you do better to do it everyday no matter what, even just do a little of it.
  Because, if you do it everyday, then it easy to do better and do much when you have time.
  But once you drop it, it hard to pick it up.

3: Action = motivation + ability + trigger 
    It means what make you take action is base on three reason:
    1:you want to do it
    2:you can do it
    3:a begingning
    
    motivation is up to you
    different level goal means you can always do it
    do it everyday means the trigger is always on
    
    
do it step by step~!
