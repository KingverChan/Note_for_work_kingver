develop log: HUAWEI OD, SDE
today, my pl tell me that if i want to be a better engineer. I must write more technology logs.
why?
1. record the promblem which you have solved. When you face it again next time, you can find the solution in your blog. And if other peron ask you the similar question.
you can give them the bolg link or you will waste your time to solve the problem again and again. Expecilly once the problem many people will ask you when you are the
owner of the problem, that is a good idea to save your time.
