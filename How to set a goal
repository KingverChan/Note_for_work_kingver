I always set a very high goal before I start to work.
At the begingning, my pasion is too much to overflow.
However, my pasion retreat day by day and finally I think the goal is too high to attatch and the time is not enough.

I read some book about how to clutivate a habit.
Here is what i get to share with youï¼š
1: a low goal is not a shame.
  It's not a shame to set a small goal. And It's not an honer to set a high goal.
  Only the goal which can fullfill is the good goal.
2: set different level for a goal.
  For example, if you want to set a goal about to remember 300 english words.
  You can dispart the goal in 3 levels>
  level one: 100 words
  level two: 200 words
  level three: 300 words
  And no matter which level you get, you are the hero of yourself.
  Oh~ I am too busy today, but it dosen't matter, i can just remeber 100 words today so that I can get my goal.
